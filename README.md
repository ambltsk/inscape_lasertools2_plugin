# inscape_lasertools2_plugin
Inscape plugin LaserTools2 based on original (lasertools)[https://github.com/ChrisWag91/Inkscape-Lasertools-Plugin]

**********************************************************************
# Why was this done

When using the very wonderful lasertools plugin, it was inconvenient that for the production of the entire model it was necessary to divide the file into parts: what should be completely engraved, where only lines should be engraved, on the inner cutouts and on the outer contour. Changes were made to the original file to determine the order and type of work. The plugin configuration file has also been changed.
